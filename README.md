# ubuntu-rhcsa-rhce-helper

This book provides an in-depth reference guide for performing all the necessary tasks in Red Hat's RHCSA and RHCE qualifications but on Ubuntu. We examine each of the exam criteria, how they are met in the RHCSA and how to perform the equivalent configuration on Ubuntu. This guide could also act as a nice reference if you are looking to move from Ubuntu to RHEL, CentOS or Fedora.
